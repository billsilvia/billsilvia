I am a PhD Student in Social Psychology at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

This account and repository are being used to expand from the world of academic statistics to the worlds of data science and programming.

I am also likely to add Doctor Who and other fandom-related projects to this repository that function outside of my academic and nonprofit work.
